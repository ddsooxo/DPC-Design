##### August 2020

# Introduction

Sacramento State's College of Engineering and Computer Science(ECS) department was bringing major changes to their resources for students starting Fall 2020 Semester. I am currently their student Graphic Design Assistant and helped the team create an infographic to inform students. This infographic is featured on this [page](https://www.ecs.csus.edu/news/articles/ecs-resources-announcement.html).

# Process

I was given a document which listed all the major changes to the resources. I then consulted with my supervisor about the graphic specs such as color schemes and dimension of the graphic.

After a few meetings with my team and supervisors, I created this infographic, adhering the color schemes to match Sacramento State's original color of green and gold. I also created a subtle honey-comb like texture for the background of the header as the mascot of the university is a hornet.

I made use of simple logos to make the infographic eye catching as well as readable.

# Tools

- Adobe Illustrator
