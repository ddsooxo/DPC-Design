<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Sacramento State’s College of Engineering and Computer Science(ECS) department were bringing major changes to their resources for students starting Fall 2020 Semester. I am currently their student Graphic Design Assistant and helped the team create an infographic to inform students. This inforgraphic is featured on this <a href="https://www.ecs.csus.edu/news/articles/ecs-resources-announcement.html">page</a>.</p>

<h1 id="process">Process</h1>
<p>I was given a document which listed all the major changes to the resources. I, then consulted with my supervisor about the graphic specs such as color schemes and dimension of the graphic.</p>

<p>After consultations with my team and supervisors, I created this infographic and adhering the color schemes to Sacramento State’s original color of green and gold. I also created a subtle honey-comb
background texture at the header as the mascot of the university is a hornet.</p>

<p>I made use of simple logos to make the infographic eye catching as well as readable.</p>
