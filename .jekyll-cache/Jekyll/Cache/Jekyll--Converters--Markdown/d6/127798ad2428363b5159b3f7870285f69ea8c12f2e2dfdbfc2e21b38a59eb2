<p>In 2019, my best friend approached me and asked me for a favor.  She asked me if I can design a logo for an upcoming project her and her colleage were working on.</p>

<p>My friend and I exchanged a couple of text messages on what sort of ideas she had for the logo.</p>

<p>Idea: Incude two tibetan youths, make it colorful, showcase the beautiful Tibetan culture.</p>

<p>The logo was created for a non-profit organization based in San Francisco Bay Area. The organization is called Nyamdudro Mentorship.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a little snippet about Nyamdu Dro Mentorship:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Tibetan, ‚Äúnyamdu dro‚Äù translates to ‚Äúgo together,‚Äù a literal representation of our belief in the power of community and collaboration. We are a platform for Tibetan youth in the Bay Area to create meaningful professional relationships.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>To create this logo, I first sketched out the drawing with pen and paper. I then scanned the picture of the drawing and uploaded it on Adobe Illustrator.</li>
</ul>

<p>I played around with bright colors to make it fun and interactive. The logo includes two Tibetan youths holding hands together. The background includes mountains which represents the Himalaya mountains. There is also a Tibetan prayer flag.</p>
